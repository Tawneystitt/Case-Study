<h2>Description:</h2>
  This is a Case Study I have created in 410 over IBM Corporation
  <br></br>
IBM Corporation was considered a valuable company in 1990. It was also considered one of the
best companies to work for and they also had in place a no-layoff policy for their employees. In the
background of the company, there were extremely high-level issues that needed to be addressed. These
issues started to be revealed to the public around 1991 and 1993. IBM lost billions of dollars in profit
during that time frame. When the recognition of the client/server model of computing grew, this led to
reduced sales for mainframe, which was half of IBM’s proceeds and around 70 to 80 percent of its
earnings. Customer’s purchasing outcomes had a huge impact on IBM and not in a good way.
Around 1991 the no lay-off policy was ended and for the first time at IBM, many people lost their
positions. According to an article by Baker, IBM’s machines were very good quality but at a higher cost
than their competitors. IBM was also in partnership with Microsoft, and they had differences in their
business plans. Microsoft released its first version of Windows and IBM continued advancement on
OS/2. This in return cost IBM $125 million per year and their collaboration is considered one of the
leading business mistakes to have ever occurred.
IBM had to start on major changes. Their mission was to lead in the development and
manufacture of information technologies. They focused on integrated solutions that were high quality.
As the markets shifted IBM had to become more diverse and had to take a more service-orientated
approach that would fit with the needs of clients. When there was a leadership change and Gerstner
took on the position at IBM leading the turnaround for the company, he reflected on what the customers
were saying. The customers revealed that they don’t need another disk drive, database, or Unix server
company. What they needed was the one thing IBM did great at which was to help integrate and create
global solutions.
According to an article written by Gratton, one of the five forces would be the competitive rivals
between companies, Gratton mentions that the more competitors there are in an industry the fiercer the
competition is, and everyone is fighting for their share. IBM had to handle intense competition from big
companies like Intel, and Microsoft that were widely popular in the market. These were the big players
and were very established in the market. They also had to deal with the threat of new entrants which
was start-up companies. These startup companies introduced new innovative technology into the market
as well but at a lower cost.
Another one of the five forces would be supplier power, IBM has established relationships with
their suppliers and had good influence over them which was a positive for the company. This allowed
IBM to maintain costs and ensure the supply quality was handled for its products. Customer power
according to an article by Gratton, is when the customers have more strength, they can put pressure on
an organization to provide better products for a lower cost. For IBM customer power was a heavy
influence, a lot of choices from existing rivals and new competitors drove customers to have many
options to choose from. This increased customer negotiating power. There was also the threat of
Substitutes for IBM they faced intense competition around the rise in personal computing and clientserver
technology. This posed a huge risk to IBM’s mainframe business model. The newer technology
that was offered was more flexible for a lower cost, which shifted what the customers were purchasing.
These changes resulted in IBM’s organizational structure changing as well. Previously IBM
operated with its existing structure and this structure dominated for some time but as these forces
mentioned altered what the customers were purchasing, it affected IBM’s revenue drastically. They
needed to change their outdated structure, which was slow in response to market changes. As the IT
industry changed, the organizational structure of IBM had to keep up with the newest innovations. IBM
shifted towards a more decentralized structure enabling quicker responses to technological
advancements, while fitting their customer's needs. Gerstner worked hard at changing the structure and
investing in his customers. Gerstner even as far as reorganizing the company into one global
organization, despite the high opinion that it should be broken up. He put together meetings where
senior executives would meet to talk about IBM’s strategic approach going forward, he pushed for
intense collaboration, and this was a good move when pushing forward in his plan. IBM came up with a
new server called New York-centric computing. The company also decided not to continue with the OS/2
model, or with chips. Their organizational structure as far as roles and responsibilities changed as well
from February 1993 to November 1994. IBM’s model was originally distributed, segmenting several areas
based on different functionalities. In Gerstner’s new model, IBM was centralized to main business
segments, streamlining organizational structure.
The stakeholders for IBM were the employees of IBM, who were extremely worried about job
security especially after the no-layoff policy was taken out of place and many lost their positions.
Employees were also concerned about career progression as they weren’t sure where the company was
headed. Investors were interested in stable financial returns and long-term sustainability for IBM
company. When the financial downfall made it to the press this changed investor’s belief level in IBM.
Management was another stakeholder group that was focused on implementing Gerstner’s organization
plan with efficiency, helping to steer the company through the hard trials it faced. Suppliers are another
stakeholder group that also depended on IBM for business from their orders and payments. Another
stakeholder would-be competitors who were heavily influenced by what their business plan of action
would be based on IBM’s choices. Customers are another stakeholder group and IBM customers were
seeking reliable and updated technology solutions that were at a good cost. IBM had to ensure they
were meeting the needs of their clients to maintain success and their role in the market.
When Gerstner had to decide on where to lead the company, they could have chosen a few
different alternatives such as breaking up IBM into smaller companies, this would have a huge impact on
employees and managers. This would be good for investors but would lead to a lot of job insecurity and
job loss for employees and managers. This would also change the customer and stable supplier
relationship IBM had in place. Another alternative would be to continue their focus on mainframe
technology even though this was said to be “ending”. This could result in customers choosing a different
option to go with. This would also provide some stability, but not much for suppliers and employees of
IBM. For Investors, this option would risk the relationship between the two. The third alternative would
be to change into a service-orientated organization. This could result in long-term opportunities for
IBM’s employees which would provide stability. Customers could also benefit from the newer technology
that IBM would be offering to the market, and this could in return increase their revenue. Investors
would possibly have a long-term sustainability and stable relationship with IBM.
The best option would be alternative 3 where IBM transforms into a service-orientated company.
This results in allowing IBM to cater to what the customer's wants are, this option would also help to
bring in the latest technology that will overall lead to higher satisfaction from the customer base. while
delivering with their new organizational structure in place at a faster rate than before. Employees are
also offered an opportunity to grow and learn more in the space and have job security, which is
important in a company. According to an article by Igniyte research was conducted by Corporate
Reputation Magazine and found that of the 1,000+ people who took part in the study 86% of women
and 67% of unemployed men would not join a company with a bad reputation. A person with great
experience and who has a lot to offer is going to research a company before entering into a new role, if
this person sees that the company has a bad reputation with how they treat those who work for them,
they may go a different route when choosing a position. For suppliers, this might affect them more
heavily because they will have to meet the changing needs of IBM. This option would benefit Investors
because they would be also introduced to the expanding market of IT services, which could result in
continued income for the investors.
In conclusion, Gerstner was able to turn around IBM with the shift in the way he changed the
organization and brought it forward as a whole instead of breaking it up into smaller independent
companies. He restored the employee’s security while introducing newer technology into the market. By
focusing on customer feedback and what IBM could bring to the table, he was able to continue IBM in
the right direction. The recovery efforts he made were noticed, and respected. Gerstner’s execution
ultimately brought IBM out of its hardship, into a better future for everyone involved in the IBM
corporation.
